==========

This wss a very Android mini-game for students to play in a college activity(Shawlane2013).
* We have posted many QRcode posters in college at that night, students can start the game at a 
start point, and follow the server-generated route to find the next several 
checkpoints (QRcode posters).
* For some checkpoints, there would be several QRcode posters, the messages 
from each posters were different, which made the game a little more interactive 
and varied.

### Caution
The server is no longer exist, me and my friend decided to terminate the server due to the end of AWS free tier.
